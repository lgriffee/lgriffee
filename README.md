### About Me 👋🏻

**I’m a front-end developer & interface designer with 4+ years of experience building design systems for global non-profit and tech companies.**

My experience solving problems at the intersection of design and development equips me with a unique ability to leverage my understanding of both disciplines to facilitate better collaboration between designers and engineers, accelerate product development, and improve user interface code quality.

Currently I’m working as a front-end developer on [Shopify’s Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/). 🚀✨
