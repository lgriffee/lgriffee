### About Me 👋🏻

**I’m a design engineer with over 7 years of expertise in front-end development, design systems, and product design for leading e-commerce and outdoor education companies.**

My experience solving problems at the intersection of design and development equips me with a unique ability to leverage my understanding of both disciplines to facilitate better collaboration between designers and engineers, accelerate product development, and improve user interface code quality.

Currently I’m working as a front-end engineer on Shopify’s e-commerce platform, empowering millions of entrepreneurs worldwide as they start, grow, and manage their businesses.
