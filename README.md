### About Me 👋🏻

**I’m a design engineer with 7+ years of experience across frontend engineering, design systems, and product design for top commerce and outdoor education organizations.**

My experience solving problems at the intersection of design and development gives me a unique ability to bridge both disciplines—enabling stronger collaboration between designers and engineers, accelerating product development, and improving user interface code quality.

In recent years, I’ve focused on building and evolving design systems for mission-driven organizations, creating the foundations that support consistent, accessible, and efficient product development at scale.

I’m passionate about using design and code to help socially responsible companies tackle complex, real-world problems.
